  <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the "ReadYours" mobile application (the "Service") operated by ReadYours ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
  <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. By using the Service, you also acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to our Privacy Policy, available at <a href="privacy.html">readyours.app/privacy.html</a>. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data.</p>
  <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms or the Privacy Policy, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>ReadYours is a mobile application that enables users to practice foreign languages by generating personalized texts with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Users can create custom content by specifying criteria such as the language they want to practice, text type, difficulty level, length, and theme. The application also offers additional features like word translation, pronunciation listening, and digital flashcards.</p>

  <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
  <p><strong>a. Eligibility and Age Restriction:</strong> To use the Service, you must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required for digital consent in your country). If you are under 13, you may not use the Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>
  <p><strong>b. Account Creation:</strong> You must create an account to use certain features of our Service. You agree that the information you provide to us upon registration is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate or incomplete information constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
  <p><strong>c. Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions, Payments, and Refunds</h2>
  <p><strong>a. Subscription Plans:</strong> ReadYours offers various subscription plans (a "Subscription") for access to certain premium features. By purchasing a Subscription, you agree to pay the specified fees.</p>
  <p><strong>b. Payment and Billing:</strong> Subscription payments are processed and billed through the application stores ("App Store") such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Payments will be charged to the payment method associated with your App Store account. The terms and conditions of the App Stores apply. ReadYours does not directly collect or store your credit card or bank information.</p>
  <p><strong>c. Automatic Renewal:</strong> All subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the current subscription period unless you cancel. The renewal will be charged at the then-current subscription rate. To avoid automatic renewal, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before your current subscription period ends.</p>
  <p><strong>d. Cancellation Policy:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through the subscription management section of your mobile device's operating system (App Store or Google Play Store settings). After cancellation, you will continue to have access to the premium features until the end of the period for which you have already paid.</p>
  <p><strong>e. Refund Policy:</strong> Payments made for subscription fees are generally non-refundable. Refund requests are subject entirely to the refund policies of the respective App Store (Apple or Google). You must direct your refund requests directly to the relevant App Store.</p>
  <p><strong>f. Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change our subscription fees in the future. If there is a price change, we will provide you with reasonable prior notice before the change takes effect.</p>
